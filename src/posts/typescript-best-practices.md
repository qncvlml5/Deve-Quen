# TypeScript Best Practices in 2024

TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development. Let's explore the best practices that will help you write more maintainable and type-safe code.

## Type Safety

- Use strict mode
- Leverage type inference
- Define proper interfaces
- Use type guards effectively

## Code Organization

```typescript
// Example of a well-organized TypeScript module
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

class UserService {
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

1. Generics
2. Utility Types
3. Decorators
