# Testing React Applications

Testing is crucial for maintaining high-quality React applications. Let's explore different testing strategies and tools.

## Testing Tools

- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Cypress
- MSW (Mock Service Worker)

## Example Tests

```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import Counter from "./Counter";

describe("Counter", () => {
  test("renders counter with initial value", () => {
    render(<Counter />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Count: 0")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test("increments counter when button is clicked", async () => {
    render(<Counter />);
    const button = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /increment/i });
    await userEvent.click(button);
    expect(screen.getByText("Count: 1")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Testing Strategies

1. Unit Testing
2. Integration Testing
3. End-to-End Testing
4. Snapshot Testing
